        "text": "Ultimate Launchpad Pick Trade is not only a launchpad but also a  trading platform  that offers  streaming  and chat services, along with  incentives  for its users. Launchpad Aggregator First, Pick Trade operates as a launchpad aggregator. This means that anyone who creates a token through the platform can choose to deploy it on any existing launchpad built on Solana,  benefiting  from  creator rewards  from  both  the underlying launchpad and  Pick.trade . We currently support:  PumpFun ,  LetsBonk ,  Boop ,  Believe App ,  Moonit  &  Moonshot . Additionally, any token creator who decides to go through Pick Trade gains access to a  suite of services  to enhance their tokens. These  services  include market makers, advertisements, KOLs, etc. Trading Platform Besides serving as a launchpad for token launches, Pick Trade is also a sophisticated trading platform. It offers charts and an  intuitive interface , along with advanced features pretty similar to those of trading bots like Axiom or Gmgn. Pick Trade enables users to  buy and sell with a single click , enhancing and accelerating the use of trading features by eliminating the need to sign messages when executing transactions. This streamlines the process, making swaps exceptionally fast and efficient, with transactions executed in  less than a second , establishing  Pick.trade  as the fastest trading platform built on Solana. On-chain Social Network People can interact and  chat  with each other, as well as participate in  video live-streams  launched by token creators. Unlike PumpFun,  any token  from Solana can benefit from these features. Pick Trade has created a  social network layer  that allows users to trade and engage with one another on any token's page. This innovative feature serves as the foundation for future developments, whether for memecoins or any other type of token. For instance, with the deployment of stocks on-chain by  xStocks , Pick Trade is the only platform where you can trade stocks and earn incentives while interacting with fellow traders. Gamified dApp Each user has their own  avatar  along with  customizable accessories , depending on their level. The more they interact on Pick Trade, the more XP they earn, allowing them to access  exclusive perks  and  incentives ."

After that, they need to fund their account with the official Solana token, $SOL, through blockchain transfers or via the off-chain ramp operated by  Transak  (using a debit/credit card). This process allows traders to engage on Pick Trade  without the need to sign any transactions , thereby speeding up blockchain interactions like buying or selling memecoins. As a Token Creator If you wish to create a token, you simply have to click on the « Create » button and fill in all the fields with the token details you wish to provide. After that, you'll have the choice to deploy your token on any launchpad you wish. Each launchpad offers a different range of rewards (also called creator rewards) that will be given to the developer's wallet. You can compare these rates with our  comparison tool . Once created, you can leave it as is or opt for one of the  extra services  that Pick Trade offers to level up your token. Then, you can manage your position and supply alongside the chart of your token. You can also launch a  video live-stream  or interact with your holders through the  chat  section. You can even grant admin rights to people to moderate your chat. Don’t forget to claim your creator fees on  Pick.trade  and the underlying launchpad. As a Trader As a trader, you always need to ensure you have enough credit to trade tokens. If you do not have sufficient credit, you can easily top up using the official Solana token, $SOL, through blockchain transfers or a debit/credit card. To navigate through opportunities, you can scrape the  Pick Zone  to scout for tokens. To help you find the next gem, you can also use our unique  gem filter . By clicking on any token, you'll be able to analyze and trade it. You can also interact with others through a dedicated  chat  available on each token's page on the platform. Your profile section will help you keep an eye on your trade history, positions and  XP earned ."

Customization Some aspects of the platform are customizable such as the profile section. Each user can create and customize their own  avatar  with a variety of accessories. Some of these are available from the start, while others must be unlocked. Similar to most video games, you need to earn XP and advance through levels by interacting more with the platform and completing achievements to unlock additional assets. Earning The points-earning system is based on on-chain interactions. For each transaction made on  Pick.trade , users will  earn XP  which are added to their profiles. At specific milestones, users will advance to a higher level. With each level gained, new perks, accessories and  incentives  become unlockable. We also introduce the concept of  badges , which can be earned by reaching specific achievements. These badges can be obtained by completing various on-chain or off-chain tasks, such as inviting 10 friends or creating a token on the platform. Social Network Expanding user interaction on the platform, the system incorporates a  dynamic social network  feature. Users can showcase their avatars, display earned badges and share their achieved levels. This profile visibility enables members to explore each other's progress including PnL statistics and trading history. It creates an engaging community environment where achievements are publicly recognized, offering users the opportunity to learn from successful traders. Such integration of social elements into the trading platform not only enhances user experience but also adds a layer of motivation and learning. Integrating incentives and gamification into a trading platform is crucial. Therefore, we will continue to expand these features and focus on making the trading experience more enjoyable for users."

Both the total supply and circulating supply remain unchanged at launch, ensuring that the market cap is equal to the fully diluted value. However, a  a deflationary  mechanism has been established to reduce the supply over time, increasing the rarity and value of each token held by users. The deflationary mechanism operates in conjunction with the  treasury , which grows over time and enables the Pick Trade team to continuously buy back $PICK and burn a portion of it. Utility Since Pick.trade is a gamified dApp, there needs to be a  main currency  at the core of the platform to power the  gamified features  and rewards programs. $PICK is used to leverage these gamified features and is also distributed as an  incentive  for users and token creators. The more users interact on  Pick.trade , the more points they earn, allowing them to unlock exclusive perks and additional $PICK or $SOL tokens.

This comprehensive approach involves aggregating the strengths of various platforms built on Solana like PumpFun, Jupiter, Axiom and others, to create a robust solution that caters to both  new and experienced traders . The goal is not just to replicate existing platforms, but to elevate them by introducing advanced features and seamless integration, offering users an unparalleled experience. By incorporating gamification and social interactions, we aim to make on-chain trading and token creation  accessible and appealing  to everyone. On-chain Trading Developing a more comprehensive set of trading tools and features, such as limit orders and copy trading. Creating additional perks and features for the reward system. Adding some trading-related games. Offering both Pro and Light versions. Developing a mobile app. Enabling multichain trading. Token Creation Expanding the range of options for creating different token types. Providing tools for managing token supply (lock, burn, etc). Offering additional services to assist with token development. Developing more features for video live-streaming such as live interactions. Supporting a wider variety of launchpads, including those from other blockchains. Pro & Light Version Our target audience includes both beginners and experienced traders. For this reason, we plan to develop  two versions : a Pro and a Light version. The Pro version will feature multiple advanced screeners, adjustable trading settings, scraping tools and more. Meanwhile, the Light version will provide simple interactions for buying and selling any token with ease. This includes options to purchase with a debit or credit card, receive tutorial assistance if needed, access courses through our academy, set up auto-slippage, and more. Gamification & Mobile App Development To enhance user engagement and accessibility, we plan to significantly  improve  our  gamification   features . By incorporating more badges, competitions, perks and rewards, we aim to deliver the same dopamine rush associated with video games, specifically tailored for on-chain trading. We also plan to develop some on-chain games, such as « Predictions » or « Lottery », which are attractive, easy and fun to play. Additionally, we are committed to developing a robust mobile app, free and accessible on all smartphones, to support our growth. Multichain Integration Our ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive trading platform across multiple blockchains, focusing only on the most impactful ones such as Base or Hyperliquid. Our multichain approach facilitates global access, allowing users to create or trade any token seamlessly, without the hassle of cross-chain complexities."
