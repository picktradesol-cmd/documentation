        "text": "Next-gen Trading App Pick Trade is revolutionizing the Solana ecosystem by functioning as far more than a traditional trading app. It is a  comprehensive hub  for launching, trading, analyzing, and socializing. By integrating functionalities that are usually isolated across different applications such as minting (PumpFun), trading (Axiom), or analyzing (DexScreener), Pick Trade offers a unified suite designed for speed, convenience, and efficiency. Trading Platform & Token Screener Pick Trade establishes itself as one of the fastest trading platform built on Solana, executing transactions in  less than a second . Bot-Level Features:  The platform offers an intuitive interface with advanced features similar to trading bots. One-Click Trading:  Users can buy and sell with a single click. By eliminating the need to sign messages for every transaction, the process is streamlined for exceptional speed. Advanced Analysis:  Acting as a powerful token screener, Pick Trade provides sophisticated charts, tools, and detailed data, allowing users to evaluate any token on the market with the depth of dedicated analysis platforms. Launchpad Aggregator Pick Trade operates as a premier launchpad aggregator. This unique structure empowers token creators to deploy their assets on  any existing launchpad  built on Solana while managing it through one interface. Thus benefiting from creator rewards from both the underlying launchpad and  Pick.trade . Beyond deployment, Pick Trade offers advanced customization: creators can easily configure reflection mechanics to automatically reward holders or implement deflationary models to induce scarcity.  Furthermore, the  creator suite  provides professional post-launch support, connecting projects with market makers, marketing agencies, KOL and more. On-chain Social Network Pick Trade introduces a social layer that transforms solitary trading into a community experience. Unlike competitors restricted to specific niches, any token on Solana can benefit from these social features. Users can engage in real-time through dedicated  chat rooms  on any token’s page and participate in interactive  live video streams , fostering a lively environment around every asset. This social foundation is designed to support future developments across all asset classes, extending well beyond standard crypto. For instance, through the integration of xStocks, Pick Trade stands as the only platform where users can trade on-chain stocks while earning incentives and interacting with fellow traders.  Gamified dApp Experience To drive engagement, the platform is fully gamified. Every user possesses a unique  avatar  with customizable accessories that reflect their status. Most interactions on the platform contribute to a user's accumulation of XP. As traders level up, they unlock exclusive rewards. Furthermore, over  50 quests  are available, offering unlockable badges to showcase achievements within the community."

        "title": "How it Works",
        "text": "How it Works Users must create an account (no KYC required) by connecting an existing Phantom wallet or registering with an email address. Upon registration, a non-custodial Pick Trade wallet is automatically assigned to the user. Next, users must fund this account with $SOL via a blockchain transfer. This setup allows traders to engage on Pick Trade  without signing  individual transactions, significantly speeding up interactions such as buying or selling memecoins. As a Trader As a trader, you always need to ensure you have enough credit in your Pick Trade account to trade tokens. If your balance is low, you can easily top up with $SOL using the deposit address found in your profile section. To navigate through opportunities, you can scrape the Pick Zone to scout for tokens. To help you find the next gem, you can also use our unique filters. By clicking on any token, you'll be able to analyze its chart and trade it at the best speed. You can also interact with others through a dedicated chat room available on each token's page on the platform. Your profile section will help you keep an eye on your trade history, positions and XP earned. Meanwhile, the reward center is the hub for tracking your earned rewards and unlocked achievements. As a Token Creator If you wish to create a token, you simply have to click on the « Launch » button and fill in all the fields with the token details you wish to provide. After that, you'll have the choice to deploy your token on any launchpad you wish. Each launchpad offers a different range of rewards (also called creator rewards) that will be given to the token creator's wallet. Then, you can custom your token settings with deflationist or reflectionist mechanic and add some support to your project with the creator suite. Once created, you can manage your position and supply alongside the chart of your token. You can also launch a video live-stream or interact with your holders through the chat rooms. You can even grant admin rights to people to moderate your chat. You can claim all your creator rewards on  Pick.trade , including the one from other launchpads."

Trading assets onchain and interacting with smart contracts need to be easier, more fun and more attractive. The approach must be the same as how video games are seen today. Customization Several aspects of the platform are customizable, starting with the profile section. Each user can create and personalize their own  avatar  with a wide variety of accessories. While some items are available immediately, others must be earned. Just like in video games, users need to earn XP and advance through levels to unlock these exclusive assets. This is done by actively engaging with the platform and completing various achievements. Earning A XP-earning system based on on-chain interactions has been implemented, featuring a total of  100 levels . For each transaction executed on Pick Trade, users earn XP which is added to their profiles. At specific milestones, users advance to higher levels, with each subsequent level requiring more XP to complete. As users level up, new perks become unlockable. Currently, three types of rewards are distributed upon leveling up: Cashback:  Users start with 20% cashback, which increases as they level up, reaching a maximum of 35% at Level 100. Avatars:  Exclusive avatar skins remain locked until specific levels are reached. $PICK:  $PICK tokens are distributed based on the volume of the weekly buyback executed by the team. Quests & Badges Pick Trade has also introduced trading badges, which are earned by unlocking specific achievements. These achievements are varied and based on both on-chain and off-chain tasks, such as inviting 10 friends or completing 50 swaps on the platform. A total of  152 badges  have been implemented, each with a distinct  rarity rank . Users can proudly display these badges on their profiles, allowing anyone to view their achievements. Leaderboard On top of that comes the leaderboard, a general scoreboard ranking users based on their total point earnings. Points can be earned by completing quests, unlocking badges, reaching new levels or even by simply connecting to the platform daily. The points system is detailed on the leaderboard page. This leaderboard is then utilized by the Pick Trade team to allocate  airdrops , distribute rewards, and grant exclusive perks. Reward Center No gamified platform is complete without a dedicated space for users to track and claim their success. The Pick Trade reward center is an interactive hub where users can monitor their progress through levels and achievements, as well as claim their earned rewards. A total of four financial rewards are available: Cashback:  Earn up to   35% cashback   depending on your trading volume on the platform. Referral:  Earn up to 40% lifetime commission   on every user you refer. Pick Trade Creator Rewards:  Token creators earn 20% of the fees from every swap on their token. Launchpad Creator Rewards:  Claim rewards generated by the underlying native launchpad directly on  Pick.trade  (such as the pumpfun creator rewards). Integrating incentives and gamification into a trading platform is crucial. Therefore, we will continue to expand these features and focus on making the trading experience more enjoyable for users."

This provides a highly effective way for creators to connect directly with community members and holders. The platform ensures a user-friendly experience, featuring smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation to easily browse the various live streams hosted on the site.

By highlighting tokens experiencing extreme volatility or nearing migration, it allows traders to instantly identify and capitalize on the market's most explosive opportunities. Reflection A reflection token automatically  redistributes  a portion of creator rewards  among all holders . This feature is available for any token and can be fully adjusted by the creator prior to launch. For example, if a creator selects a 20% reflection rate, 20% of the total creator rewards will be distributed to all holders every 30 minutes. Activating this feature requires a one-time fee of 0.033 SOL at deployment. Additionally, Pick Trade retains a 2% fee from the creator rewards to cover distribution costs. Buyback & Burn This follows a similar approach to the reflection model, except that here, creator rewards are used to buy back the token and  instantly burn  the purchased supply. This creates a  deflationary token , actively increasing scarcity and rarity. Activating this feature requires a one-time fee of 0.033 SOL at deployment. Additionally, Pick Trade retains a 2% fee from the creator rewards to cover execution costs.

Characteristics $PICK is deployed at low valuation with no additional tax fees. Both the total supply and circulating supply remain unchanged at launch. However,  a deflationary  mechanism has been established to reduce the supply over time, increasing the rarity and value of each token held by users. The deflationary mechanism operates in conjunction with the treasury, which grows over time and enables the Pick Trade team to continuously buy back $PICK and burn a portion of it. Utility Since Pick.trade is a gamified dApp, there needs to be a  main currency  at the core of the platform to power the gamified features and rewards programs. $PICK is used to leverage these gamified features and is also distributed as an incentive for users and token creators. The more users interact on Pick.trade, the more XP and points they earn, allowing them to unlock exclusive perks and additional $PICK or $SOL tokens. All features available on Pick.trade remain free and do not require holding any $PICK. Tokenomics Since $PICK is launched as a fairlaunch model, no supply is locked. Nearly all the supply is liquid at launch and remains tradable. However, the team is securing 30% of the supply for the following purposes: Airdrops CEX listings Investors (1.5%) Additionally, the treasury is consistently funded through revenue from platform revenue. 10% of this treasury is used to continuously  buy back $PICK , with 5% of that amount being  burned ."

The treasury, holding a mix of $PICK and $SOL tokens, not only fuels the platform's various features but is also crucial for the deflationary strategy. The treasury is funded by revenue generated from: Fees paid by users (traders & token creators). Premiums from advertisements and boosted tokens. Every week, 10% of revenue is designated for buying back $PICK tokens, with half of this amount  burned  to reduce supply, while the other half strengthen the rewards vault, enhancing incentives for users participating in gamified program, contests and giveaways. This mechanism creates a deflationary system and generates steady  buying pressure  over time. If treasury contributions significantly increase, the team will arrange additional giveaways and increased rewards. On the other hand, the treasury is also used to  invest in marketing and project development  while ensuring that infrastructure costs are covered. The team remains transparent about the company's investments and will consistently invest heavily in marketing through both Web2 and Web3 campaigns/funnels."

        "title": "Roadmap",
        "text": "Roadmap The team is driven by a commitment to address the gaps existing in current platforms by providing a richer and more  versatile   trading ecosystem . This comprehensive approach involves aggregating the strengths of various platforms built on Solana like PumpFun, Jupiter, Axiom and others, to create a robust solution that caters to both  new and experienced traders . Instead of replicating existing platforms, we aim to elevate them with advanced features and seamless integration to offer users an unparalleled experience. By incorporating account abstraction solutions, we will make on-chain trading and token creation accessible and appealing to everyone. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a  universal trading app  that includes social interactions and gamified features for various purposes, such as trading memecoins, creating tokens, buying stocks, making predictions and more. On-chain Trading Developing a more comprehensive set of trading tools and features, such as limit orders and copy trading. Creating additional perks and features for the reward system. Adding predictions market. Adding some trading-related games. Offering both Pro and Light versions. Developing a mobile app. Enabling multichain trading through omnichain solutions. Token Creation Expanding the range of options for creating diverse asset types, such as utility tokens. Providing tools for managing token supply (lock, burn, etc). Offering additional services to assist with token development. Developing more features for video live-streaming such as live interactions and donations. Supporting a wider variety of launchpads, including those from other blockchains. Pro & Light Version Our target audience includes both beginners and experienced traders. For this reason, we plan to develop  two versions : a Pro and a Light version. The Pro version will feature multiple advanced screeners, adjustable trading settings, scraping tools and more. Meanwhile, the Light version will provide simple interactions for buying and selling any token with ease. This includes options to purchase with a debit/credit card, receive tutorial assistance, access courses through our academy, set up auto-settings and more. Gamification & Mobile App Development To enhance user engagement and accessibility, we plan to significantly  improve  our  gamification   features . By incorporating more badges, competitions, perks and rewards, we aim to deliver the same dopamine rush associated with video games, specifically tailored for on-chain trading. We also plan to develop some on-chain games, such as « Predictions » or « Lottery », which are attractive, easy and fun to play. Additionally, we are committed to developing a robust mobile app, free and accessible on all smartphones, to support our growth. Multichain Integration Our ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive trading platform across multiple blockchains, focusing only on the most impactful ones such as Base or HyperEVM. Our multichain approach facilitates global access, allowing users to create or trade any token seamlessly, without the hassle of cross-chain complexities. Unlike any other platform, we aim to build a model where users will have their funds in the same account across any blockchain, with no need to bridge, swap or change wallets. To achieve this, we will explore omnichain solutions."
