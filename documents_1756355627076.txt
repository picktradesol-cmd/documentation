This means that anyone who creates a token through the platform can choose to deploy it on any existing launchpad built on Solana, benefiting from creator rewards from both the underlying launchpad and  Pick.trade . We currently support:  PumpFun ,  LetsBonk ,  Boop ,  Believe App ,  Moonit  &  Moonshot . Additionally, any token creator who decides to go through Pick Trade gains access to a  suite of services  to enhance their tokens. These  services  include market makers, advertisements, KOLs, etc. Trading Platform Besides serving as a launchpad for token launches, Pick Trade is also a sophisticated trading platform. It offers charts and an  intuitive interface , along with advanced features pretty similar to those of trading bots like Axiom or Gmgn. The swap feature is particularly fast and efficient (currently taking approximately 1200 ms for a transaction to be executed). On-chain Social Network People can interact and  chat  with each other, as well as participate in  video live-streams  launched by token developers. Unlike PumpFun,  any token  from Solana can benefit from these features. Pick Trade has created a  social network layer  that allows users to trade and engage with one another on any token's page. This innovative feature serves as the foundation for future development. For instance, with the deployment of stocks on-chain by  xStocks , Pick Trade is the only platform where you can trade stocks and earn incentives while interacting with fellow traders. Gamified dApp Each user has their own  avatar  along with  customizable accessories , depending on their level. The more they interact on Pick Trade, the more XP they earn, allowing them to access  exclusive perks  and  incentives ."

        "text": "Gamify trading While Pick Trade has the ambition to become a global trading platform, one of the main focuses is to  gamify the trading experience . Trading tokens and interacting with smart contracts need to be easier, more fun and more attractive. The approach must be the same as how video games are seen today. Customization Some aspects of the platform are customizable such as the profile section. Each user can create and customize their own  avatar  with a variety of accessories. Some of these are available from the start, while others must be unlocked. Similar to most video games, you need to earn XP and advance through levels by interacting more with the platform and completing achievements to unlock additional assets. <figure><img src=\"../.gitbook/assets/Customize your avatar.JPG\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> Earning The points-earning system is based on on-chain interactions. For each transaction made on  Pick.trade , users will  earn XP  which are added to their profiles. At specific milestones, users will advance to a higher level. With each level gained, new perks, accessories and  incentives  become unlockable. We also introduce the concept of  Badges , which can be earned by reaching specific achievements. Each badge grants XP and additional rewards. These badges can be obtained by completing various on-chain or off-chain tasks, such as inviting 10 friends or creating a token on the platform. <figure><img src=\"../.gitbook/assets/Capture.JPG\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> Social Network Expanding user interaction on the platform, the system incorporates a  dynamic social network  feature. Users can showcase their avatars, display earned badges and share their achieved levels. This profile visibility enables members to explore each other's progress including PnL statistics and trading history. It creates an engaging community environment where achievements are publicly recognized, offering users the opportunity to learn from successful traders. Such integration of social elements into the trading platform not only enhances user experience but also adds a layer of motivation and learning. Integrating incentives and gamification into a trading platform is crucial. Therefore, we will continue to expand these features and focus on making the trading experience more enjoyable for users on-chain."
