This means that anyone who creates a token through the platform can choose to deploy it on any existing launchpad built on Solana, benefiting from creator rewards from both the underlying launchpad and  Pick.trade . We currently support:  PumpFun ,  LetsBonk ,  Boop ,  Believe App ,  Moonit  &  Moonshot . Additionally, any token creator who decides to go through Pick Trade gains access to a  suite of services  to enhance their tokens. These  services  include market makers, advertisements, KOLs, etc. Trading Platform Besides serving as a launchpad for token launches, Pick Trade is also a sophisticated trading platform. It offers charts and an  intuitive interface , along with advanced features pretty similar to those of trading bots like Axiom or Gmgn. The swap feature is particularly fast and efficient (currently taking approximately 1200 ms for a transaction to be executed). On-chain Social Network People can interact and  chat  with each other, as well as participate in  video live-streams  launched by token developers. Unlike PumpFun,  any token  from Solana can benefit from these features. Pick Trade has created a  social network layer  that allows users to trade and engage with one another on any token's page. This innovative feature serves as the foundation for future development. For instance, with the deployment of stocks on-chain by  xStocks , Pick Trade is the only platform where you can trade stocks and earn incentives while interacting with fellow traders. Gamified dApp Each user has their own  avatar  along with  customizable accessories , depending on their level. The more they interact on Pick Trade, the more XP they earn, allowing them to access  exclusive perks  and  incentives ."
